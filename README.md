# Sales Forecasting: Advanced Time Series Analysis for Business Intelligence

## Project Overview

This comprehensive capstone project applies advanced time series analysis and machine learning techniques to forecast sales performance across multiple product lines, countries, and temporal dimensions. The analysis combines statistical modeling with business intelligence to provide actionable insights for strategic planning and revenue optimization.

## Business Problem

Sales forecasting is critical for effective business operations and strategic planning:

- **Resource Allocation**: Data-driven decisions for sales team deployment
- **Risk Management**: Anticipate market downturns and seasonal variations

## Dataset Description

**Dataset:** Comprehensive Sales Transaction Data  
**Size:** 2,823 sales records spanning 2003-2005  
**Scope:** Global sales across 7 product categories and 19 countries  

### Key Features:
- **Sales Metrics**: Revenue, quantity ordered, pricing data
- **Product Information**: 7 product lines (Classic Cars, Vintage Cars, Motorcycles, etc.)
- **Temporal Data**: Order dates, quarters, months, years
- **Customer Data**: 92 unique customers across multiple countries
- **Geographic Data**: Sales across 19 countries and 73 cities

### Product Performance Analysis:
- **Classic Cars**: $3.9M revenue (highest performing category)
- **Vintage Cars**: $1.9M revenue (premium market segment)
- **Motorcycles**: $1.2M revenue (consistent performer)
- **Lower volume categories**: Trains, Ships, Planes, Trucks & Buses

## Methodology

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Temporal Trends**: Year-over-year growth analysis (2004 peak: $4.7M)
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Monthly and quarterly sales distribution
- **Geographic Analysis**: Country-wise revenue performance
- **Customer Segmentation**: Top 20 customers contributing significant revenue
- **Product Line Performance**: Revenue and quantity analysis across categories

### Time Series Analysis

#### Data Preprocessing
- **Stationarity Testing**: Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF = -51.92, p < 0.01)
- **Data Resampling**: Daily aggregation with linear interpolation
- **Train-Test Split**: 60% training, 20% testing, 20% validation

#### Statistical Modeling
- **ARIMA Models**: Univariate time series forecasting
  - ARIMA(1,1,1): AIC = 50,454.45
  - ARIMA(0,1,0): AIC = 52,336.15 (baseline comparison)
- **Model Diagnostics**: Residual analysis, ACF/PACF plots
- **Stationarity Confirmation**: Series confirmed stationary (p < 0.01)

#### Advanced Multivariate Modeling
- **Feature Engineering**: Random Forest feature importance analysis
- **Key Predictors Identified**: MSRP, Quantity Ordered, Price Each
- **SARIMAX Implementation**: Seasonal ARIMA with exogenous variables
  - Improved AIC: 45,979.47 (significant improvement over univariate)
  - Strong coefficients: MSRP (15.67), Quantity (102.57), Price (38.81)

### Machine Learning Integration
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Feature importance ranking
- **Top Features**: MSRP, Quantity Ordered, Price Each identified as primary drivers
- **Model Validation**: Cross-validation for robust feature selection

## Key Business Insights

### Revenue Performance
- **Peak Year**: 2004 generated $4.7M (34% above 2003)
- **Geographic Leaders**: USA dominates international markets
- **Seasonal Trends**: Q4 typically strongest, Q1 recovery patterns
- **Product Mix**: Classic Cars represent 39% of total revenue

### Market Intelligence
- **Customer Concentration**: Top 20 customers drive significant revenue share
- **Price Sensitivity**: Strong correlation between MSRP and sales volume
- **Quantity Effects**: Bulk orders significantly impact revenue patterns
- **Geographic Opportunities**: Emerging markets show growth potential

### Forecasting Results
- **36-Month Projections**: Stable forecast around $3,553 per transaction
- **Confidence Intervals**: Statistical bounds for risk assessment
- **Model Reliability**: SARIMAX outperforms univariate models significantly
- **Business Application**: Monthly forecasts enable proactive planning

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Core analysis and modeling platform
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computing
- **Statsmodels**: ARIMA, SARIMAX time series modeling
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning and feature selection
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Statistical visualization and trend analysis
- **Plotly**: Interactive business intelligence dashboards
- **SciPy**: Statistical testing and correlation analysis

## Model Performance

### Statistical Validation
- **ADF Test Results**: Confirmed stationarity (p < 0.01)
- **Model Comparison**: SARIMAX superior to univariate ARIMA
- **Residual Analysis**: Diagnostic plots confirm model adequacy
- **Forecast Accuracy**: MAE and RMSE metrics for performance assessment

### Business Value
- **Improved AIC**: 45,979 vs 50,454 (9% improvement)
- **Multivariate Insights**: Integration of business drivers
- **Actionable Forecasts**: 36-month strategic planning horizon
- **Risk Quantification**: Confidence intervals for scenario planning
